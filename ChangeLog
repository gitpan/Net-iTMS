0.04 -> 0.10

    * HUGE rearrangement/rewrite of code.  Refactored by creating Request,
      Album, Artist, Genre, and Song objects.  Data is fetched efficiently
      and transparently.  Still missing some parts -- see the TODO section
      in Net::iTMS's POD -- but these will be easy to implement.
    
    * See all the doc for more usage info.  It's dead easy.

0.03a -> 0.04
    
    * Bug fixes in Net::iTMS::XML -- still are probably a bunch of edge
      cases.
    
    * Changed method names in Net::iTMS -- NOT backwards compatible.

    Undocumented except in Subversion.  If it really matters, email me,
    or just use diff yourself.
